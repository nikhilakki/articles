    "## Speeding UP CPython\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "CPython is the most common and widely used Python implementation, generally when developers refer to Python, they are talking about C implementation of Python or CPython. There are other implementations of Python, here's a list straight out of Python.org -\n",
    "\n",
    "1. IronPython (Python running on .NET)\n",
    "2. Jython (Python running on the Java Virtual Machine)\n",
    "3. PyPy (A fast python implementation with a JIT compiler)\n",
    "4. Stackless Python (Branch of CPython supporting micro threads)\n",
    "5. MicroPython (Python running on micro controllers)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple ways of speeding up CPython, from JIT based compilation methods to writing C extensions for Python and we are going to explore the later.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is Cython?\n",
    "\n",
    "Cython is a programming language which aims to become a superset of the Python, with Cython it is possible to write C extensions for the Python language while being as readable and approachable as Python. Cython is fast at he same time provides flexibility of being object-oriented, functional, and dynamic programming language. One of the key aspects of Cython include optional static type declarations which comes out of the box. The source code gets translated into optimized C/C++ code and compiled as Python extension modules. This allows for both very fast program execution and tight integration with external C libraries, while keeping up the high programmer productivity for which the Python language is well known.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's test Cython speedups with some good old CS program - finding fibonacci sequence upto an integer value given by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Code -\n",
    "\n",
    "__Pure Python version :__\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def fibonaci_series(n: int):\n",
    "    i = 0\n",
    "    a = 1\n",
    "    b = 1\n",
    "    fib = []\n",
    "    fib.append(a)\n",
    "    fib.append(b)\n",
    "    while i < n:\n",
    "        c = a + b\n",
    "        fib.append(c)\n",
    "        a = b\n",
    "        b = c\n",
    "        i += 1\n",
    "    return fib\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "__Cythonized version :__\n",
    "\n",
    "```cython\n",
    "cpdef list fibonaci_series(int n):\n",
    "    cdef int i = 0\n",
    "    cdef int a = 1\n",
    "    cdef int b = 1\n",
    "    cdef int c = 0\n",
    "    cdef list fib = []\n",
    "    fib.append(a)\n",
    "    fib.append(b)\n",
    "\n",
    "    while i < n:\n",
    "        c = a + b\n",
    "        fib.append(c)\n",
    "        a = b\n",
    "        b = c\n",
    "        i += 1\n",
    "    return fib\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, syntactically the only difference is that Cython uses static typing (just like how you would do it in C/C++/Go or other static typed language). The key is static typing for the speed up, although Cython is quite forgiving in terms of it's declarations when compared to C/C++, one could get away with just writing Python pure python syntax in Cython (you also wouldn't see much of the speed up...duh!)\n",
    "\n",
    "### You said complied ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, you do have to compile Cython code.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 1 - Write your Cython code in *.pyx file\n",
    "* Step 2 - In your main.py or app.py (which ever file you use as an entry point) write -    \n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pyximport\n",
    "pyximport.install(build_dir=\"./build\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will create build files *.pyx files along with the transpiled code in a C file with *.c extension, this is actual C code (over ~2750 lines in our case)! Don't worry this is generated by Cython transpiler and it is already optimized for the purpose you have written it _(pretty cool isn't it !?)_\n",
    "* Step 3 - Run your program as you would run any normal Python code! yes, that is it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Our benchmark results -\n",
    "___Cython without static typing___\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python run_test.py 10000\n",
    "Python test took 4.7995266050000005 secs\n",
    "Cython test took 3.575472554000001 secs\n",
    "Cython speed up over Python : 1.3423474890418636 times\n",
    "```\n",
    "___Cython with static typing___\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python run_test.py 10000\n",
    "Python test took 4.829826579 secs\n",
    "Cython test took 0.28026456299999936 secs\n",
    "Cython speed up over Python : 17.233097639247422 times\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "***Disclaimer: Please note that the tests are based on logic completely written in Python, the code doesn't rely on any 3rd party libraries. Results may differ based the underlying library / framework one would use and the structure of the code***\n",
    "\n",
    "### When would I use Cython ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the high performance demanding libraries for Python are written in Cython/C/C++.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some libraries Cython (and there are many more...)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Numpy (Numerical computing)\n",
    "- Scipy (Scientific computing)\n",
    "- Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning library)\n",
    "- Pandas (Data Analysis)\n",
    "- Spacy (State of the art, Natural Language Processing (NLP) toolkit)\n",
    "\n",
    "These are some advance use cases for Cython, I typically use Cython for speeding up loops and conditionals [for, while, if else etc.] (yes, that's your low hanging fruit, got for it!)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Possible Cython alternatives \n",
    "\n",
    "1. [MyPy](https://github.com/python/mypy) & [MyPyC](https://github.com/mypyc/mypyc)\n",
    "\n",
    "While Cython has great compatibility with CPython ecosystem, one needs to rewrite the Python implementation as it introduces new syntax and a different way of approach towards programming in Python, the developer may feel overwhelmed. There are these two interesting projects called mypy and mypyc. Mypy is an optional static type checker for Python (leverages type annotations in Python 3.6 and above), Mypyc on the other hand aims to create C Extension from the mypy type checked code! Do you think this is a better approach when compared to Cython? (if you have an interesting thought, do share it in the comments section)\n",
    "\n",
    "All this sounds great, but the project is still in its infancy and it can't be used for production yet, I would recommend if you are interested follow the project closely, I know I will :-)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org)\n",
    "\n",
    "Well Numba takes a different approach altogether, it use JIT compilation techniques and LLVM infrastructure to speed things up. Numba is more suited for Numpy based code, since it is optimized and built specifically for scientific computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would have to go further in-depth to understand and discuss these approaches, that would be out of scope for this article (may be for another time ;-))\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Where do I find the demo source code?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the link to [Github repo]()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What next?\n",
    "\n",
    "I have covered may be less than a percent of what you could be doing with Cython, I'm by no means an expert in this, but I try to keep myself abreast with the tech, feel free to share your thoughts. I have listed a few links in the resources section for you to explore.\n",
